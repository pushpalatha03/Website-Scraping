# Website-Scraping
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Python script that scrapes product information from Amazon search results and saves it to a CSV file. This data can then be used for further analysis, such as pricing trends, customer sentiment analysis, and market research.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python : The programming language used for scripting the web scraping process.
- BeautifulSoup (bs4): A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used to extract data from the Amazon web pages.
- requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests, utilized to fetch the HTML content of Amazon search result pages.
- Pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, employed to organize the extracted data into a structured format.
- NumPy: A Python library for numerical computing, used for handling numerical data efficiently.

## Setup
**Web Scraping Setup:**
1. Identified the target website containing product details.
2. Examined the HTML structure to locate elements containing product information.

**HTML Parsing with BeautifulSoup:**
1. Utilized BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content fetched from the website.
2. Extracted relevant data such as product names, prices, rating and availability.
3. Managed diverse HTML structures and tags to ensure comprehensive data extraction.

**Data Transformation and Storage:**
1. Cleaned and organized extracted product data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Transformed structured data into CSV format.
3. Ensured CSV files included appropriate headers and were formatted correctly for easy import into data analysis tools.

**Data Analysis Preparation:**
1. Created a well-structured dataset ready for various analytical purposes.
2. Prepared the dataset for analysis, including market research, pricing analysis, and inventory management insights.
